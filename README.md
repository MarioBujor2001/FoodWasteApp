# FoodWasteApp
This project was built using Express and NodeJS for server side functionality and React to give it a beautiful interface. The app aims to reduce food waste by giving people the chance to donate food items that they no longer consume. The easy to use interface resembles a generic marketplace where people can exchange food.
